The gb.gsl component provides high level mathatics functions to
Gambas3. It replies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) to provide
it's underlying functionality. This component simply wraps the GSL
in a Gambas API wrapper. 

Not all GSL functions are implemented. It made little sense to 
implement GSL functions that support data types that Gambas does 
not support. 

This component is exerimental and still in the development stage.
The code and component is highly volitile at this stage of development.
Use it at your own risk!
