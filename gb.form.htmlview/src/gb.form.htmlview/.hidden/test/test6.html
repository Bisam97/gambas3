				I show that in all kinematic situations, π is 4. For all those
				going ballistic over my title, I repeat and stress that this
				paper applies to kinematic situations, not to static or geometric
				situations. I am analyzing the equivalent of an orbit, which is
				caused by motion and includes the time variable. In that
				situation, π becomes 4. I will also remind you this is not just
				a theory: it has been indicated by many mainstream experiments,
				including rocketry tests and quantum experiments (see links
				below). It has also now been proven by my own experiments (see
				link below). </FONT></FONT>

				This paper has now been up for almost ten years. In that time, it
				has become somewhat overgrown with addenda and other links, which
				I have added as my argument has advanced. Readers soon found
				confirmation wherever they looked, and I have added those links
				to bolster my thesis. I have made some effort to clean up the
				paper recently, though most will still find it to be—how shall
				I put it—overrich. It is a long and complex question, and as
				usual I have been exhaustive in researching it. One critic called
				this paper “discursive”, though he doesn't seem to know what
				the word means. Nothing I say below is off-subject or digressive.
				The problem of π touches on many other questions, and can't be
				discussed in any depth without hitting those questions at some
				length. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Whatever
				these planted critics may be paid to say, the subject is now
				pretty much settled. No one who studies my arguments can fail to
				recognize that I discovered something very important here, so we
				must assume the people trolling me on the web are agents of some
				sort, wasting our time with low-level debating tricks. In the ten
				years this paper has been up, I have yet to see a reply or
				debunking worth addressing.** None of them even appear serious on
				the surface, and none are from recognized people in any field.
				Most are from anonymous sources. This is to be expected, I
				suppose, since it is difficult to debunk something that is
				obviously true. The standard method of debunking the truth—the
				method we see at places like Snopes, for instance, or other
				mainstream spook fronts—is with low-level character
				assassination, couched lies, and other oily subterfuge. We have
				certainly seen that in the mainstream response to me from the
				beginning, but we have seen little else. I am only telling you
				this because Google seems to be in on the game. Any search on me
				is littered in the first pages with this misdirection, and
				someone who didn't know any better would assume I really am
				widely considered to be a crank. I'm not, as you can see <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/critics.pdf">here</A>.
				Probably more of my papers (on both sites) have gone viral than
				the papers of anyone else in history, though you have to dig a
				bit to figure that out. My science papers are being mobbed by
				mainstream physicists as well as by interested amateurs,
				including this paper. In fact, I have it from inside sources that
				the mainstream has already begun correcting its kinematic
				equations that include π, though they are of course not publicly
				admitting it. Apparently they are trying to figure out how to
				proceed without giving me any credit. What they don't understand
				is that it doesn't matter: I know and they know and they can't
				change that. They can't suck the information out of my head or
				their own heads, and those are the heads that determine this.
				Even if they somehow succeed in stealing this from me, they will
				always </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>know</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>they stole it. That won't make
				things better for them, it will make things worse. The only hope
				for these people is coming clean, and we can only hope they
				eventually figure that out. As I have said many times, if they
				start playing nice, so will I.] </FONT></FONT>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>I suppose I
				shouldn't be surprised this paper has ruffled feathers. It was
				meant to. I made my title provocative on purpose, so it is no
				wonder it has succeeded in provoking. You don't promote a
				revolution in science with meekness, and no one has ever accused
				me of being meek. They have accused me of a lot of things, but

				on the internet with this paper, and of course I embraced that
				with my usual fervor. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>That said,
				before we get started let me answer a couple of prejudices. Many
				readers, especially those just coming to my papers, will hit a
				wall at some point in this paper. No doubt many already hit that
				wall when they read the title. Understandably, π as 4 is a big
				pill to swallow. This is admittedly one of my most difficult
				papers to absorb. It alone is a huge red pill, and will start you
				on a journey far more fantastic and interesting than any Matrix
				movie. Beyond that, this paper cannot stand alone. It is a
				mistake to start with this paper. Those who do start with this
				paper will very likely be led to believe I am simply doing the
				calculus wrong. To these people, I say that it is not I who am
				doing the calculus wrong. It is Newton and Leibniz and Cauchy and
				everyone since who has been doing the calculus wrong. I have
				earned the right to write this paper by first writing three
				important papers on the foundations of the calculus. <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/are.html">The
				first</A> shows that the derivative has been defined wrongly from
				the beginning, and that the derivative is a constant differential
				over a subinterval, not a diminishing differential as we approach
				zero. There is no necessary approach to zero in the calculus, and
				the interval of the derivative is a real interval. In any
				particular problem, you can find the time that passes during the
				derivative, so nothing in the calculus is instantaneous, either.
				This revolutionizes QED by forbidding the point particle and
				bypassing all need for renormalization. <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/lemma.html">The
				second paper</A> proves that Newton's first eight lemmae or
				assumptions in the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>Principia</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>are all false. Newton monitors
				the wrong angle in his triangle as he goes to the limit,
				achieving faulty conclusions about his angles, and about the
				value of the tangent and arc at the limit. Finally, <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/avr.html">the
				third paper</A> rigorously analyzes all the historical proofs of
				the orbital equation a=v</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>2</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>/r,
				including the proofs of Newton and Feynman, showing they all
				contain fundamental errors. The current equation is shown to be
				false, and the equation for the orbital velocity v=2πr/t is also
				shown to be false. Those who don't find enough rigor or math in
				this paper should read those three papers before they decide this
				is all too big a leap. I cannot rederive all my proofs in each
				paper, or restate all my arguments, so I am afraid more reading
				is due for those who really wish to be convinced. This paper
				cannot stand without the historical rewrite contained in those
				papers, and I would be the first to admit it.</FONT></FONT></P>

				December 10, 2012</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>:
				after an email from a reader concerning <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">the
				Taxicab geometry</A>, it dawned on me that Hilbert's metric is
				basically equivalent to my &quot;metric&quot; in this paper. In
				Hilbert's metric, π also equals 4! And it equals 4 for the same
				basic reason π equals 4 in this paper: my &quot;limit&quot; is
				approached in the same way his is. See below, where I show the
				approach to the limit using circle geometry. Well, Hilbert uses
				the same sort of analysis. Only difference is, I dig a bit deeper
				into the kinematics, showing the real cause of the problem. At
				Wikipedia, they say the difference in metrics is caused by
				single-axis motion:</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="arial"><FONT SIZE=4>This
				is essentially a consequence of being forced to adhere to
				single-axis movement: when following the Manhattan metric, one
				cannot move diagonally (in more than one axis simultaneously).</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="arial"><FONT SIZE=4><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But
				that isn't the cause. The cause is the motion itself. The motion
				brings the time variable into play, which adds another degree of
				freedom to the equations. You may now consider the fact that
				contemporary physicists often use the Manhattan distance or
				metric when they get in a jam, especially at the quantum level.
				The Manhattan metric is the same as Taxicab geometry. And you can
				now understand why using this metric helps them: as I show in
				this paper, standard geometry fails because it fails to include
				the time variable explicitly, which fouls up the math and then
				the physics. In kinematic situations like the orbit, the correct
				math and physics includes the analysis I provide in this paper,
				in which π=4. And this means that all the hotheads** on the
				internet going ape over my paper now have to take on Hilbert as
				well. I don't esteem Hilbert and never have, but in this case
				having him as an ally is a considerable boost. The mainstream
				esteems him, often more than Einstein or Newton, it would seem.
				So if my proposing π=4 automatically qualifies me as a crank or
				crackpot, these critics will have to explain why the same does
				not apply to Hilbert. Is Hilbert a crackpot for proposing that
				π=4?</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Also of
				considerable interest is the fact that in Taxicab geometry, the
				circumference is 8r, as I show in this paper. Furthermore, all
				this also connects to <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/avr.html">my
				earlier corrections to a=v</A></FONT></FONT><A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/avr.html"><SUP><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>2</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>/r</FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>,
				where I show that the denominator should be 2r rather than r. The
				same thing would be found in Taxicab geometry, by extending the
				equations just beyond where Hilbert took them. To read more on
				this, you may now consult <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/manh.pdf">my
				latest paper</A>, where I extend my comments of this section and
				offer some more diagrams and animations, including a video on

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>[</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Addendum
				April 2014.</B></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Another
				reader has now helped me add to this proof, since she has
				reminded me that the arc of a cycloid is also 8r. That is, in the
				cycloid, π is replaced by 4, just as in the Manhattan metric. I
				don't know why I didn't think to include this before, since it is
				so obvious. We should have always asked more persistently why the
				arc of the cycloid is 8r while the circumference is 2πr. As a
				matter of kinematics, it makes no sense. The same point draws
				both, so why the 21% miss? I will be told that it is because with
				the circumference, the circle is not moving along an x-axis, but
				with the cycloid, it is. It is the difference between a rolling
				circle and a non-rolling circle. It is this lateral movement that
				adds the 21%. But whoever is telling me this is missing a very
				important point: in the kinematic circle I am talking about, the
				circle is also rolling. If you are in an orbit, for instance, the
				circle is not moving laterally, but a point on the circle </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>is</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>moving. </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>The
				circle is rolling in place</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>,
				and it is moving exactly like the point in the cycloid.
				Therefore, we see it is not the lateral motion that adds the 21%,
				it is the rolling alone. A static circle and a circle drawn by
				motion are not the same. The number π works only on the given
				static circle, in which there is no motion, no time, and no
				drawing. Any real-world circle drawn in time by a real object
				cannot be described with π.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>If we study
				the generation of the cycloid closely, we find more evidence of
				this, since the arc of the cycloid isn't some sort of integration
				of the circumference with the distance rolled. It can't be,
				because some point on the circle is always contiguous with the
				flat surface. We would have to </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>slide</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>the circle in order to add any
				of the x-distance traveled. What is actually happening is that
				with the cycloid, the x-to-y integration of distances is
				explicitly including time, as you see here:</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><BR><IMG SRC="intpi.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0><BR><BR>In
				that integral, we have three variables or functions: x, y, and t.
				Study the second and third lines of the math, where we are
				explicitly following the value of t. It is not the sine or cosine
				of x or y we are following, it is the cosine and then sine of t.
				In that integration, we have three degrees of freedom or a
				3-vector. So it is not the lateral motion that is causing the
				difference, it is the inclusion of time. To calculate the arc
				length of the cycloid, we need the integral which includes dt.
				But when we calculate the circumference, we don't include any dt.
				So the methods of calculation don't match. Despite that, we use
				the naive static circumference that includes π when we calculate
				orbits. This is illogical, since all orbits include time. They
				should be solved with integrals like the one above, not with the
				static circumference calculated from π.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>You may wish
				to differentiate the two as <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/are.html">I
				do in my long calculus paper</A>. There I differentiate between
				length and distance. A length is a given parameter that does not
				include motion or time. It is geometric only. But a distance is a
				length traveled in some real time, so it requires motion. A
				length is not kinematic, while a distance is. The circumference
				2πr is a length. The circumference 8r is a distance.]</FONT></FONT></P>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The
				Pythagoreans had some inkling of this error. They were never
				happy about the irrational number π , just above the number 3.
				We have been taught that the Pythagoreans were unhappy about π
				due to the fact it was not rational. But their unease was likely
				caused by a more fundamental problem. They may have intuited the
				problem I am showing you on some level. They seem to have smelled
				that something was wrong here. Meaning, perhaps it was not the
				<I>value</I> of π that bothered them, much less its status as
				rational or irrational. No, they didn’t even spend much time
				seeking a precise value for it, since they had no respect for π
				to start with, regardless of how you categorized it. Had it been
				rational, they would have had no more respect for it. They had no
				respect for π because they suspected it was an outcome of bad or
				incomplete math. They did not want <I>any</I> rational or
				irrational number slightly above 3, no matter what it was,
				because they felt the right answer must be 3. What bothered them
				most is that they could not complete the math. I will do that
				now. Unfortunately, although I will show that their unease was
				justified, their intuition was faulty. The correct number is not
				3 but 4.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>In previous
				papers, I showed that classical geometers have sought solutions
				by ignoring the time variable completely. The equations of
				geometry happen at some imaginary instant. Not only are we at a
				limit with regard to length (since all lines have no width,
				etc.), we are at a limit with regard to time. We have reached the
				limit where t=0, since time is not passing. We don’t take into
				consideration how long it takes to draw the lines or curves, we
				simply take them as given. We do not imagine traveling along
				those lines, or imagine seeing them traveled by a point. The
				circle is not an orbit, for instance, it is just a circle,
				existing all at once. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But, as I
				also pointed out before, geometry cheats in this, since geometry
				is supposed to represent the external world, but the external
				world never exists in this way. Never once in the history of the
				universe has a circle drawn itself or existed all at once.
				Currently we assume that π exists in the real world, but I will
				show that π exists only in abstract geometry, and that abstract
				geometry is kinematically false. That is to say, π does not and
				cannot exist in physics or applied mathematics, except as a fudge
				factor. We require it so often in our equations only because our
				equations are incomplete or misdefined. If our equations
				contained all the proper logic and transforms, π would be
				extinct. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Let me first
				explain what I mean by that in a bit more detail. The number π
				is a relationship. We already know that. Currently we think it is
				a relationship between the diameter and the circumference. The
				problem is, we treat the diameter and the circumference as
				equivalent mathematical entities, when they are not. One is a
				line and one is a curve. If we study the line and the curve with
				a bit more rigor, we discover they aren’t directly comparable.
				To state it yet another way: we assume that we can straighten out
				a curve like a piece of string, measure it as a straight line,
				and then compare that new length to any line we like. Physically,
				this turns out to be a false assumption. The only place we can do
				that is in abstract geometry, where time does not exist, and
				where lines and curves can be “given”, rather than drawn or
				created in any physical sense. If we are given lines and curves,
				and if we can ignore time, then we get π as the relationship
				between the diameter and the circumference. The number π <I>only</I>
				exists when we are given absolute pre-existing values, when the
				circumference is treated as a simple length, and when we ignore
				time. But since with any real circle both these assumptions are
				necessarily false, π does not exist in any real circle. In any
				real circle, the relationship between the diameter and the
				circumference is not π , since the circumference may <I>not</I>
				be thought of as a straight-line distance. Because the
				circumference cannot be created with a single velocity vector
				(and the diameter can), the two numbers cannot be compared
				directly. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<HR>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But let us
				start at the beginning. By definition, a velocity vector cannot
				curve. A velocity takes place in one dimension or direction only.
				In a velocity, there is only one distance in the numerator and
				one time in the denominator. These times and distances are also
				vectors, and may not curve. But to create a curve, either
				mathematically or physically, requires at least two velocities
				happening over the same interval. Or, to put it another way, it
				requires two distances measured over the same time interval. If
				we sum these velocities over the same interval, we achieve an
				acceleration, and thereby—assuming the two velocities are at an
				angle—a curve. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>If we bring
				time back into the problem of the circle, we find that every line
				or distance becomes a velocity and every curve becomes an
				acceleration. So the diameter becomes a velocity and the
				circumference becomes an acceleration. All we have to do is
				imagine the lines being drawn. The pencil must have some velocity
				or acceleration as it moves along the line or curve. Likewise
				with a planet drawing out an orbit, or any other possible
				creation of a circle in the real world. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Once we do
				this, we see that in comparing the diameter to the circumference
				in any real circle we are comparing a velocity to an
				acceleration. But you cannot directly compare two numbers, when
				one is a velocity and one is an acceleration. Or, you can if you
				like, but the new number you get from the ratio is not going to
				be a number that carries any real meaning in it. It is certainly
				not the same as comparing one distance to another. For example,
				if you compare one distance to another by putting them into a
				fraction and achieving a new number, this new number will contain
				useful information. It will tell you how long one line is
				compared to the other, obviously. But if you compare a velocity
				and an acceleration, what information do you get? Say you achieve
				the number 5, which tells you the acceleration is five times the
				velocity. Does that tell you anything about distances? Yes, it
				might, if you develop a transform. But without a transform and a
				bit of thinking, the number 5 isn’t telling you anything. It
				certainly isn’t telling you that some distance is 5 times some
				other distance. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To give a
				specific example, what if my acceleration is 3 and your velocity
				is 1. Can we compare those two numbers directly? No, we cannot
				put them into a fraction or any other equation without doing some
				more work upon them. We cannot claim that I have done anything
				three times as much as you. With an acceleration of 3, my
				velocity could be anything at a given interval, and my distance
				traveled likewise. What if my acceleration is π and your
				velocity is 1? Is π the value of any real relationship between

				need more information.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To say it
				another way, think of the calculus. In the calculus, velocities
				and accelerations can't be put into the same equation—without

				acceleration the second, so we have to notate a velocity variable
				or function with a single quotation mark, and an acceleration
				with a double (or something similar). If we don't, the equations
				will soon implode. The functions indicate different rates of
				change, so they can't be compared directly. The functions have to
				be kept separate and handled in the right way, and everyone knows
				that. But in the historical orbital equations, they haven't been
				kept separate. Whenever we compare the circumference to the

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>This is

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To show this

				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel2.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=379 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Here we have
				a Cartesian graph of a velocity, with axes labeled x and t. As we
				know, a velocity on such a graph is a straight line. The line
				stands for or represents the velocity. But what does the length
				of that line represent? In this example, x = 2 and t = 4, so v =
				x/t = .5. But the length of line v is much longer than .5 units.
				The length of line v can only be found by the Pythagorean
				Theorem, and it turns out to be about 4.47. Now, we can ask what
				is the ratio of line v to line x, and we will find it is about
				4.47/2 = 2.236, which is an irrational number. An esoteric ratio?
				Of course not, since the length of v is not only a meaningless
				length here physically, it is not even the real velocity. By the
				definition of velocity, the velocity is the distance over the
				time, so using the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of v is
				just foolish. I claim that, in a physical situation, comparing
				the length of the circumference of a given circle to the length
				of its diameter is just as foolish. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel3.jpg" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=506 HEIGHT=462 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>We can draw a
				circle on a Cartesian graph, too. We can’t make one of our axes
				a time axis, but we know we can draw a circle on an x/y graph,
				since a well-known equation comes with it (x<SUP>2</SUP> + y<SUP>2</SUP>
				= r<SUP>2</SUP>). Here we are taught that the circle represents
				an acceleration, as all curves are accelerations on Cartesian
				graphs. But what about the length of the circumference of this
				circle: what does it represent? Just as with the line
				representing the velocity in the first illustration, it
				represents nothing here. You wouldn’t think of comparing that
				“length” to the radius or the diameter in this illustration,
				so why would you do it when you take away the graph?</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Of course,
				this analysis begs the question: what “graph” is a real
				circle drawn on in the real world? When a planet “draws” an
				orbit around a star, what mathematical background are we using?
				Put that way, this problem starts to look very complex. We have
				three dimensions, x, y, and t, and a complex motion. The orbit is
				not just a velocity <I>or</I> an acceleration, it is a
				simultaneous velocity <I>and</I> an acceleration. To draw out the
				circle, the planet has to be expressing both a tangential
				velocity and a centripetal acceleration over every dt. We are
				told that the planet will have an “orbital velocity”, but
				that wording is criminally reductive and misleading. Not only
				does the planet NOT have an orbital velocity, it does not
				precisely have an orbital acceleration either. It does have a
				sort of acceleration, but that acceleration is not like any
				first-degree acceleration we are accustomed to measuring. No, it
				is a very odd beast altogether. It must be called an acceleration
				for two reasons: 1) It curves. A velocity is a vector and cannot
				curve. 2) It requires a constant force. A velocity is achieved
				with a single force. An acceleration requires a continuous force.
				A circle requires both a single force and a continuous force,
				therefore it must be the expression of some sort of acceleration.
				But it is a unique compound acceleration, compounded of both an
				acceleration and a velocity.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>And that begs
				another question: is 2πr/t a velocity? No, since a velocity
				cannot curve. Is it an acceleration? No, since you can’t
				achieve an acceleration by dividing a distance by a time. What is
				it? It is a floating heuristic device, a piece of fake math that
				misdirects us. It causes us to think of the orbit as an abstract
				geometric shape, where time can be stirred back in in a sloppy
				manner at the end. But neither the orbit nor the circle should be
				thought of that way. As I will show in more detail below, 2πr/t
				is actually a variable or second-degree acceleration, of the form
				x/t<SUP>3</SUP>. This is because π is already an acceleration
				itself. This gives 2πr/t the dimensions of x/t<SUP>2</SUP>/t,
				which reduces to x/t<SUP>3</SUP>. This is logical, since we need
				the three t variables in order to express the simultaneous
				tangential velocity and centripetal acceleration that makes up
				the orbit. The velocity contributes one t variable and the
				acceleration contributes the other two. The orbit is neither a
				velocity nor a simple acceleration. It is a second-degree
				acceleration.*</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now,
				hopefully, you begin to see the problem. Historically, we have
				been seeking a relationship between distances, and historically
				we have thought that π has been an expression of that
				relationship. But it isn’t. The number π is an expression of
				the relationship between two lengths that exist only in abstract
				geometry, and abstract geometry is physically false. In the real
				world, if we want to know the relationship between the diameter
				and the circumference, we have to look at the relationship
				between a velocity and a <I>second-degree </I>acceleration.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>You will say,
				“But surely that acceleration will give us a distance, as will
				the velocity. Are you saying that the distance given by that
				acceleration is not 2πr?” Yes, that is precisely what I am
				saying. If you use straight-line motion to measure everything
				(which is what we do physically), then a curved string must be
				longer than a straight string. And the very simple reason for
				that is that it must take longer for any real body to travel
				along the curve than along the straight line. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>One key term
				in that last paragraph is this one: “straight-line motion.”
				Notice that I do not say, “the straight line.” In reality, we
				do not use a straight line to measure, we use straight-line
				motion. We use a velocity vector to measure the real world. This
				can be seen very clearly in my explanation above: The real world
				includes time. In physics, you simply never have a distance
				divorced from time, like you have in geometry. Every distance
				comes with a time, and cannot be separated from it. When we
				insert time back into the circle equations, all the lengths
				become velocities. The diameter is not a length, it is a
				velocity. Now, if we compare the diameter to the circumference,
				what we are really doing is <I>measuring</I> the circumference
				with the diameter. So, if we are measuring with a velocity, and
				it takes longer to travel a curve than a straight line, the curve
				must be longer. This must be true even when the curve and the
				straight line have the same length in abstract geometry. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Another key
				term in the paragraph before the last one is this one: “it must
				take longer.” When measuring a curve with a straight line or an
				acceleration with a velocity, we are not measuring with x so much
				as we are measuring with t. Look at it this way: if you have a
				constant velocity, then the distance traveled is simply a
				function of time. If you travel two lengths, the one that took
				longer will be longer. Since a curve is not equivalent to a
				straight line, we should measure them with time instead of
				length. We can tell how long the curve is by seeing how long it
				takes us to travel it. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Finally,
				remember that the distance traveled by an acceleration is never
				just the velocity times the time. So neither an orbital velocity
				nor an orbital acceleration could be expressed by the term 2πr/t.
				If you are given a normal acceleration and seek the distance
				traveled in some time, you must use the equation x = at<SUP>2</SUP>/2.
				But we don’t have a normal acceleration; we have a variable
				acceleration, one that is not linear, and we seek the distance
				traveled in some time. What equation do we use? We are in new
				territory here, since there is no standing equation to plug into.
				We must create it from whole cloth.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel.jpg" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=399 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To arrive at
				that equation, let us first look at some other thought problems.
				These thought problems, with their accompanying illustrations,
				may give us a clue how to proceed. As our first thought problem,
				let us say you are in a spacecraft traveling at velocity v. You
				are approaching a planet. You happen to know its gravity
				precisely, so you arrange to intersect its field at precisely the
				right angle and distance, so that your velocity creates a stable
				orbit. In real life, this maneuver would require some
				adjustments, but we will assume you can slip right in there. To
				make this even more interesting, let us say that your orbit has a
				radius of fifty miles and you are going fifty miles per hour. The
				planet is very small and happens to have a gravity vector that
				makes this stable. Both logic and Newtonian mechanics tell you
				that it will take you eight hours to orbit (see the illustration
				below). Let us imagine further that you are an alien from some
				planet that knows nothing of π and that does physics a bit
				differently, and you calculate the orbital distance like this:
				your velocity was the same both before and after entering orbit;
				your engines are in the same state as they were before, both as
				regards direction and strength; you haven’t throttled up or
				down or moved a tail fin. Since distance is velocity times time,
				you calculate the orbital distance to be 400 miles. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Are you
				wrong?</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>According to
				abstract geometry and π, of course you are. The circumference of
				the orbit is about 314 miles, not 400. Your orbital velocity is
				about 39 mph, not 50. And what is slowing you down is gravity,
				which tends to pull you back slightly, working against your
				engines. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But there are
				a lot of problems here. If we use general relativity, our
				mechanics is immediately out the window, since there is no
				centripetal force. The curvature pre-exists in the orbit: it is
				not caused by a pull, so only your velocity exists. If your
				velocity is the only motion that exists, and if a straight line
				is equivalent to a curve, there is absolutely no reason you
				should not calculate the orbital distance to be 400 miles. There
				is nothing pulling you back or working against you engines, so if
				you aren’t being slowed down, you must be going the same speed.
				If you are going the same speed for the same time, you must go
				the same distance. If you aren’t being slowed down, then your
				“orbital velocity” cannot be less than your original
				velocity.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But it is
				even worse than that, from a physical viewpoint. Let us ask if it
				is possible to apply a centripetal force without affecting a
				tangential velocity. Let us assume there <I>is</I> some force
				turning the spaceship, either Newton’s gravity or some real
				force that is “warping” space. The problem with this is: the
				spaceship’s engines are off! When glossing the standard model
				response, I said that gravity was working against the spaceship’s
				engines, slowing it down. But a constant velocity requires no
				engines in space. Does the Moon have engines? No, all we require
				is an <I>initial</I> force, to get the Moon or spaceship going.
				After that it coasts at a constant velocity (this is all
				according to the standard model and the historical
				interpretation). </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To make this
				problem even clearer, let us say we want to create the appearance
				of an orbit using just the power of the spaceship. Meaning, we
				want to draw a circle in space without a central body.
				Theoretically, we should be able to do this with just two
				engines: one to get us started in the forward direction, and one
				to push us constantly toward some chosen center. This second
				engine will run all the time with a constant thrust, and its
				direction will change every moment. I hope you can see the
				problem. Even if we could build a directional thrust to the
				engine that could change smoothly and accurately, we could not
				keep this thrust from interfering with the original velocity. You
				can neither push nor pull on a real object at a true
				perpendicular to the line of motion of that object, since a real
				push or pull is never instantaneous. Our push here, like gravity,
				must be continuous, which must create some real time interval,
				which must create some non-tangential component, which must
				interfere with the initial velocity of the spacecraft. Any real
				pulling or pushing force, even one at a tangent, must tend to
				dissipate an initial velocity. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Circle
				mechanics makes this even clearer, since the force of gravity is
				not strictly perpendicular anyway. To create the circle or the
				orbit given an initial straight line velocity requires some
				backward component to the central force. You can see this
				immediately just by comparing the tangential velocity and the
				“orbital velocity”. As I showed above, and as every engineer
				knows, the orbital velocity is <I>less than </I>the tangential
				velocity. This alone proves that there is a component of force
				backward along the line of the tangent, for if there weren’t,
				the tangential velocity would have to be equal to the orbital
				velocity. In other words, gravity must pull down <I>and back</I>.
				If it just pulled down, no circle or orbit would be created.
				<I>Because</I> the spaceship is moving forward, gravity must pull
				down and back. Look at the illustration below. BC is the gravity
				vector. To go to the limit, we make the triangle ABC as small as
				we can. We cannot make it zero, since AB must have some length.
				If AB has no length, then the spaceship has zero velocity. If the
				spaceship is moving, then AB has some length. If AB has some
				length, then BC must have some backward component. If BC has some
				backward component, it must tend to diminish the velocity AB.
				QED, gravity must tend to diminish the tangential velocity of the
				spacecraft or the “innate motion” of the Moon.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The standard
				model response here is that I am wrong: the centripetal force
				must be completely perpendicular to the initial velocity at all
				times, therefore there is and can be no “backward” component
				to the force or the acceleration. I will be told that this is why
				the Moon’s innate motion does not dissipate. But if this is
				true, then why is the orbital distance less than the distance
				that would have been traveled at the original velocity? As the
				illustration shows clearly, a tangential velocity of r would
				create a distance traveled of 4d, not πd. If the centripetal
				force does not work <I>against</I> the tangential velocity, as a
				vector, then how can πd be less than 4d? To put it another way:
				if the centripetal force is completely perpendicular to the
				tangential velocity—even while we sum the times involved in a
				complete orbit—then the tangential velocity must be unchanged.
				If the tangential velocity is unchanged over each dt and the sum
				of all dts, then how is it that the orbital distance is not the
				same as the expected straight-line distance? And how is it
				possible that the orbital velocity is less than the tangential
				velocity? </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>I say that in
				order for the compound or “orbital” velocity to be less than
				the original or tangential velocity, the centripetal force must
				be working against it, in a vector sense. This is the only
				possible way the orbital distance (the circumference) could be
				less than 4d. But if the centripetal force is diminishing the
				total distance traveled, it must be diminishing the tangential
				velocity. And if it is diminishing the tangential velocity, that
				velocity must be dissipating, and the innate motion of the
				orbiter must be dissipating as well. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>In fact, if
				we accept the standard-model interpretation, the orbit would be a
				sort of perpetual motion machine. Without perturbations and other
				orbital imperfections, a planetary orbit would be perfectly
				stable, according to both Newton and the current standard model.
				It would not tend to change either inward or outward. The
				standard model allows for such a possibility in the real world,
				since neither the tangential velocity nor the centripetal
				acceleration is a cause of orbital instability. Theoretically, a
				perfectly round planet in a perfectly round orbit around a
				perfectly round star, at a distance from all other planets and
				stars, might orbit forever. And since in General Relativity,
				curvature is given rather than created, this motion conserves
				energy. Since it both conserves energy and creates potential
				energy, it must be a perpetual motion machine. Remember, we have
				a non-dissipating curve here! That is not only perpetual motion,
				that is a perpetual machine: a perpetual source of power. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now, I have
				not put the analysis in these terms in order to sell a perpetual
				motion machine. I have put the analysis in these terms to show
				that the standard model is contradictory and flawed. I need to
				get back to π, so I will tell you the end of this story and move
				on. The short answer to this problem is that circles and orbits
				aren’t created this way physically or mechanically. We can
				analyze the circle mathematically in this way if we do it right
				(which historically we haven’t), but in the real world circles
				and orbits are never created with simple tangential velocities or
				“innate motions”. A protractor does not draw a circle using a
				tangential velocity, a boy whirling a ball on a string does not
				use a tangential velocity, and no other circle is ever created in
				this way. The protractor and the boy and the tilt-a-whirl and so
				on make use of constant tangential forces, not just centripetal
				forces, and they would have to do so even if friction were not a
				factor. Regarding celestial orbits, the mechanics fails there,
				too. Velocities would dissipate, planets are not self-propelled,
				and the balance could not be maintained. As I show <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/ellip.html">in
				a series of other papers</A>, celestial orbits are more complex
				than we have been taught. They include the E/M field, for a
				start, which acts as both a balance and an engine. And we have to
				reverse the gravity vector, which makes it neither a push nor a
				pull. It is a real acceleration of the central body, so it causes
				no forces and no dissipation in the Newtonian sense. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>That being
				said, we can still analyze the orbit and the circle in much the
				way Newton taught. We can use his equations, we just have to
				clean them up a bit. To do this, lets us look again at the last
				illustration. This drawing requires a more rigorous analysis,
				both as it applies to orbits and as it applies to circles created
				in any other ways. If you have studied this problem at all, you
				have probably seen hundreds of drawings, with polygons inscribed
				and superscribed on circles and so on and on. But all those
				drawings are misdirection. The important drawing is this one.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=399 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Here we
				measure the circle with the radius directly. We treat the radius
				as a velocity instead of a distance, and then begin our trip from
				some point on the circle. I am starting at point A in this
				drawing. In the drawing, the length of the vector stands for the
				velocity, and I must draw it at a tangent. Meaning, the angle at
				A must be 90 degrees. So, if you give me the same time to travel
				as I took to draw the radius, then I will end up at point B. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But if we
				want to draw a curve, we must keep the pencil on the circle, and
				here I am way off the circle. How do we solve this? Let us solve
				the way Newton did, by inserting a second motion. To create any
				real curve requires at least two simultaneous motions. As we know
				from classical orbital mechanics, this second motion must be a
				vector pointing at the center. This motion will take us from off
				the circle to back on the circle. To get us back on the circle,
				we can postulate a constant force over the interval of motion,
				and this would give us an acceleration, just as in gravitational
				mechanics. Or, to avoid that variation, which mathematically
				would require the use of calculus, we can just postulate all our
				force at the end. In that case, the final velocity is the
				acceleration, since we have a change from zero. The acceleration
				can be found just by drawing a line from B to O. The length of
				the line BC then represents the centripetal acceleration of our
				pencil over the interval AC. Those two motions or velocities
				happen over the same interval, so the two times superimpose.
				Whatever time it took us to draw the radius initially, is the
				same time it now took us to go from A to C. Therefore we have
				measured the circumference using the radius. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But how does
				this give us a circumference? Before I show you the full math,
				let me show you the conceptual shortcut. Go back to the drawing
				above. You can immediately see that we have carved out a piece of
				pie that is 1/8 of the circle. AO = AB, so the angle at O is 45
				degrees. Eight pieces of pie means we use eight radii to measure
				the whole circle. That is 4 diameters. Problem solved. It takes
				us four times as long to travel the circumference as to travel
				the diameter, given the same velocity. If the velocities are
				equal, and the times are directly comparable, then the distances
				are directly comparable. Velocity is d/t, so if it takes us four
				times as long, the distance must be four times as much also. That
				is the only real way to compare a velocity and an acceleration,
				or a straight line and a curve. Every other analysis is
				incomplete and faulty, since every other analysis ignores the
				time variable.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel4.jpg" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=399 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now let us do
				the full math. Let us go back to the illustration, to start. Let
				us drop a perpendicular from point D so that it hits point C, as
				above. Since the angle at B is 45<SUP>o</SUP>, DB must equal DC.
				And now I will prove very quickly that AD + DC is equal to the
				curve AC, in length. As I do that, I will have also proved that
				AB is equal to the curve AC, in length, which will prove my

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The
				historical way of finding the length of arc AC is by exhaustion
				or by calculus. We look at smaller and smaller subarcs until we
				reach the limit where the arc equals the chord. The chord is
				simply the straight line from point to point: for example, the
				straight line from A to C is the chord AC. If we can straighten
				out the arc, we will have measured it, and we can use that length
				to compare to other straight lines. So we let C approach A. At
				the limit, it is assumed that the chord AC is the length
				traveled. The Greeks used this analysis and these assumptions in
				solving this problem over 2000 years ago, using the idea of
				exhaustion (which I will return to in a moment). Later, when the
				calculus was formalized, we went to an ultimate ratio, as Newton
				called it; and then we went to a limit, with Cauchy. But in all
				the historical solutions, the assumptions were as I have stated
				them in this paragraph. The main assumption being that we were
				taking the arc to the chord: approaching the chord in some way or
				fashion.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But all this
				is false. The very simple fact is that the distance traveled
				never approaches the chord. The distance does not approach

				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>In my

				down <I>and back </I>in order to take any object—either a

				think of the original velocity as AB. Then the centripetal force
				creates two other velocities: a velocity of size DB, which pulls
				the body back from B to D; and a velocity DC, which pulls the
				body down to its final destination of C. This is how we break
				down our curve into straight velocity vectors. The motion of the
				body from A to C is a summation of these three vectors. All three
				velocities happen over the same time interval, so we sum them. It
				is that simple.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>You will say,
				“That makes some sense, until we look at the actual lines. Any

				solve by exhaustion, you have to “push” the point D closer
				and closer to the curve, by dividing that curve into lots of
				little segments or steps. That is how the Greeks actually solved
				it, you foolish person. You can’t just take any large arc like

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>OK, well, let

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The problem

				arc, because even with a very large number of steps, the distance
				between each step and the curve remains real. We can sum this
				distance even at the limit, keeping the sum of the steps above
				the sum of the curve. It is not the sum of the steps that
				approaches the curve, it is the curve that approaches the chord.
				In other words, it is the hypotenuses of the little triangles
				that converges upon the curve, not the sums of the other legs of
				the triangles.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><BR>While
				I recognize that this is the common interpretation, I cannot

				longer than the chord and arc at the limit. If we apply that to
				this problem, it means that the arc cannot approach the chord at

				definition of it in the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>Principia</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>,
				so if the tangent is longer than the chord at the limit, the arc
				must be also. This means that the curve does not approach the

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><BR>You

				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Newton says that the arc is
				composed of the tangent. It is where he tells us that the orbital

				explicitly assigns the innate motion of the body to the tangent.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><BR>This
				means that the historical and current interpretation cannot be
				correct. The hypotenuses do not converge to the curve or the arc.
				No, as I show above, it is the tangent that converges upon the
				arc, but the convergence happens only when the tangent equals the
				radius. This convergence can happen only at 1/8th of the circle,
				and it happens just as I show in these papers. It happens because
				the arc is never a continuous curve, even at the limit. The arc
				is defined as a curve composed of linear or straight vectors,
				therefore it can never be continuous, if we mean by continuous
				that the time or length traveled goes to zero. Logically, the
				time or length cannot go to zero, since there is no time or
				length at zero. All numbers in math and physics imply a
				differential, and since this is so, the curve cannot be thought
				of as continuous in this way. The curve must be thought of as
				composed of linear vectors, even at the limit. And since this
				must be true, it must also be true that the path I have drawn
				above must converge upon the arc, for precisely the reasons I
				have stated. The path does converge upon the arc, in the sense
				that the path gets nearer the arc. No one can deny that, at
				least. But since the arc is not continuous even at the limit, the
				path truly does converge upon the arc, as we draw more steps.
				Since the distance doesn't change no matter how many steps we
				draw, the tangent must converge upon the arc. Or, at 1/8 of the

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Let me round
				out this “full math” by answering a couple of questions. I
				have shown the simplest full math, and it may not convince some
				people. I will be told, “It appears that your method of
				‘exhaustion’ can be used to show that any curve from A to C
				is of the same length. Beyond that, it would appear that even the
				chord AC can be shown to be equal to AD + DC, by your method.
				What makes the circle arc AC special, and why should your method
				work upon it and upon no other arc or line between A and C?”</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>It is a good
				question, admittedly, or I would not include it here. To make
				this method—which I have called exhaustion but which might just
				as easily be called approaching a limit—work, we have to push D
				toward the curve in a rigorous manner. In short, all of our steps
				have to be approaching the curve at the same rate, or the method
				will not work. For instance, if we draw a different curve from A
				to C, one that bulges out very near to D, and then we draw our
				steps, we will not be able to make those steps even. Or, to put
				it another way, we will not be able to push D toward the curve in
				an even manner. Our exhaustion will not “go to infinity” at
				the same rate all long the curve; therefore our method will not
				work, mathematically or physically. But it will work with the
				circle arc AC, and it works for the physical reason I have shown
				above: both the tangential velocity and the centripetal force are
				constant. The arc AC is created by a constant and unvarying
				process, therefore that arc can be approached by the (right)
				orthogonal vectors in a logical and rigorous manner. In fact, the
				arc AC is the only curve from A to C that can be exhausted in
				this manner, given AD and DC. All other curves are varying
				curves, and cannot be approached as a limit or exhausted in this
				direct way. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>To show why
				the chord AC cannot be approached like this, we use much the same
				analysis. At first look, it appears that you could draw steps
				along the chord AC in the same way, “exhaust” them in the
				same way by increasing the number of steps higher and higher, and
				find by this magic that the straight line AC was the same length
				as AD + DC. The reason you cannot do this is because once again
				you cannot approach the chord AC in an even manner from the point
				D. Therefore all your steps won’t go to the limit at the same
				rate, and your “method” won’t work. You will say, “Gosh,
				it seems like the straight line would be the easiest thing to
				approach in an even manner, since it is even to start with!”
				But try it and you will soon see this is not the case. The
				straight line is actually the most difficult thing to approach,
				and the impossibility of this approach is actually the easiest to
				discover. For instance, draw four equal steps along AC, then look
				at them from the point D. There isn’t any way you could have
				approached those four equal steps from D. In the method, you
				aren’t just drawing any steps you like. You are supposed to be
				drawing steps that would occur if you pushed the line AD + DC
				toward AC. Exhausting a process or going to a limit is not a
				willy-nilly process, it is a defined and rigorous process. You
				will find, if you try, that you can’t approach a line evenly
				from <I>any</I> point, using this method. No matter where you
				place D along the line AB, it will not approach AC at the same
				rate, with steps logically defined in any possible way. And it
				may eventually become clear to you why this is so: the distance
				of a line cannot be approached from off the line, because the
				line is already the distance itself. It is “even to start
				with”; therefore, it cannot be approached evenly (except by a
				parallel line of the same length). </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>As one more
				short demonstration of this, say we place D on the line AB so
				that it is equidistant from A and C to begin with. You may think
				we could make it approach AC in an even manner in this way. But
				no. If we draw smaller steps in the middle and larger ones toward
				A and C, we can force one set of steps to act right. But we
				cannot make our next set of steps act right, both in regards to D
				and in regards to our first set. To make our next set of steps
				diminish evenly, we would have to vary the rate of change along
				the steps, and this isn’t allowed. An approach to a limit must
				progress in a defined way, else the approach won't happen. An
				approach that progressed unevenly would create &quot;bumps&quot;
				as the limit was approached, and the limit would not be the curve
				we see. It is one thing to approach a limit that is a point, and
				another to approach a limit that is a line or curve. In
				approaching a line or curve, the approach has to be the same at
				all places along the curve, and to achieve this the approach must
				be monitored all along the curve, as I am showing you. </FONT></FONT>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>There are
				more abstract ways of stating this, in various mathematical

				explanation, I prefer to give the explanation. If you don’t
				comprehend the explanation, you won’t ever comprehend the math.
				To ever understand the curve or calculus, you have to study
				diagrams and do some real pushing and pulling of lines, just like
				this. A limit is not an abstract thing. It is not a concept you
				can use like a hammer, without finesse. You have to understand
				that a limit is always approached in a rigorous and defined
				manner; and if it is not approached in a rigorous manner, you
				will get the wrong answer. The same thing applies to exhaustion.

				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The very

				the arc AC to begin with. Those vectors physically created the

				they were handy. They are THE orthogonal vectors that define the

				because it was in some sense created from D. D is the physical

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now, some may
				ask what this has to do with my whole analysis of time, earlier
				in this paper. I spent many pages telling you that time changed
				the whole problem of the circumference and its measurement and
				then I offered a &quot;full math&quot; that didn't once mention
				time. Here we get into some difficulty I wanted to avoid. I have
				been trying to avoid bringing calculus into the problem here,
				since I have already been forced to redefine the calculus <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/are.html">in
				another paper</A>. Bringing all that into this paper was
				something I hoped to skirt, retaining a transparent explanation
				to the end. For some readers I will have achieved that already.
				For others (the ones asking about time now) I won't. For these I
				will attempt a transparent explanation that still avoids a full
				use of the calculus, either the historical treatment, or my own.
				When I say that we must monitor the rate at which D approaches
				AC, that rate is time. Whenever someone says &quot;rate&quot; you
				should hear &quot;time&quot;. In any physical situation, time is
				always underneath all our distance measurements. We can draw a
				circle and refuse to monitor the time involved in drawing it, but
				time is there regardless. It is there when we remember that all
				distances are velocities or accelerations; and it is also there
				when we remember that limits must be approached in some real and
				rigorous way. The curve AC cannot be straightened out like a
				piece of string because that curve is a curve made up of both
				distance and time. If you straighten it out and measure it like
				string, you are measuring the distance but not the time, and so
				you get the wrong answer. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>There are two
				ways to think of this. One is to think of time as an actual
				length itself. Say you have a curve and a line that are equal
				lengths, according abstract geometry or the string method. The
				curve will have more time &quot;embedded&quot; in it. It would
				take you more time to travel it at the same velocity (as the
				standard model already admits with its &quot;orbital velocity&quot;).
				Therefore, when you straighten it out, you should monitor both
				the distance and the time. If you do this, the time will add to
				the distance, and your curve will be appreciably longer than you
				expect. You can actually add the difference in time to the end of
				the line and get the correct answer, so thinking of time as
				embedded in the curve is not just a pretty visualization. It is
				mathematically true. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Another way
				to think of it is to think of the line and curve as made up of
				atoms. Let the atoms be the distance and the separation between
				atoms be the time. If you straighten out a curve, you must
				compress the atoms, losing somewhat of the separation. If you
				have lost this separation, then you have lost part of the &quot;time&quot;
				and therefore the distance. A curve cannot be straightened out
				without affecting its real length. This is not just a
				visualization either. It is physically true. The best way to see
				it is again with a diagram:</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><IMG SRC="vel9.jpg" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>We want to
				straighten the piece of curved string 1-4-5 out into the piece of
				straight string 1-2-3. Although it is clear that the curve is
				longer than the straight line, let us follow the standard model
				and define both strings as equal length and see what happens. I
				use this diagram because some will say that no real compression
				is involved if we imagine a string with no width. They will say
				that a real piece of string will be compressed only on the
				outside, as you straighten it, but that the inside of the curve
				will be stretched. They will say that a one-dimensional string
				will not be compressed as you straighten it. This diagram shows
				that is false. Even a piece of string composed of only one line
				of atoms, with the distance between adjacent atoms always only
				2r, will be compressed. To see this, all we have to do is roll
				ball 5 up to ball 3. If we do that, the mark that is the curve
				must leak out the ends, showing that compression took place. This
				is obviously because the line AB is equal to CDE, not to the
				curve. The curve is longer than CDE, and must be compressed to
				equal AB. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Those who are
				especially prickly will say, &quot;Well, if the curve is longer
				than AB, then the two strings were not the same length. You
				should define the curve as equal to AB.&quot; But if we do that,
				we have the opposite problem, in that we can't make the balls the
				same size in the curved string as in the straight one. If we
				define the curve as equal to AB, then we have to make our balls
				bigger along the curve. So that when we roll ball 5 up to meet
				ball 3, we again get compression. No matter how you look at it,
				you cannot straighten out a curve without materially, and
				therefore mathematically, affecting it. </FONT></FONT>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Some will say
				that this analysis assumes non-continuity, but it doesn't. It

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>But let us

				other variables are present. Time is the reason that the curve
				does not equal AB in this example. The difference between the two
				is the difference in time. And the difference is large. The
				difference between π and 4 is not small. Historically, we have

				very strange ways, and explaining myself in even stranger ways.
				Given Newton and Cauchy and the rest, I will simply be seen to be
				doing calculus <I>wrong</I>. In response, I point out that the
				invention of the calculus historically went hand in hand with
				analyzing curves, and it was invented to analyze geometric
				curves, not kinematic curves. What I mean by that is that
				calculus and trigonometry and the orthodox use of limits was used
				in an analysis that ignored time. Newton assumed that a circular
				orbit could be thought of just like a circle given in geometry,
				with no monitoring of time or velocity. In this he was actually
				even more reductive than the Greeks themselves, who at least
				asked if the point on the curve had a velocity. Some of their
				analyses toyed with this idea. But Newton never questioned that
				the distance around the circle was a raw distance, like the
				geometric circumference. This is why he wrongly called the
				orbital velocity a velocity, and this is why we still do it. We
				don't include time in the curve, we just try to add it back in at
				the end. This is why we retain the ridiculous habit of writing
				the orbital &quot;velocity&quot; as a length over a time, even
				though, as I have shown in great detail, and as was already
				understood long ago, the orbital motion is made up of three
				separate velocity vectors. Historically, common wisdom may have
				been that there were only two velocities over each dt, but in any
				case it was known that the orbital motion is not a simple
				velocity. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>The calculus
				since Newton has been an algorithm that is able to describe a
				curve, given x and y changes. What does it find? The differential
				calculus finds the slope at the tangent, which we are told is the
				velocity at that point. Problem is, I have shown that whatever is
				at that point doesn't have a velocity. It has an acceleration, at
				the least, and in the circle it has a second-degree acceleration
				(three t's in the denominator). So Newton's algorithm must fail.
				If it works at all, it can only work on a geometric circle, where
				time is not passing. But a kinematic circle is not equivalent
				physically or mathematically to a geometric circle, so the
				calculus must be reworked. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now, I have
				never claimed that the calculus is wrong, <I>in toto</I>. Newton
				was right about most things, and the calculus is a true and

				curves, and it can be used to find π in a geometric circle. It
				solves one of the problems Newton wanted to solve. But as it is
				used now, it does not solve the problem of physical circles,
				because physical circles are not geometric circles. Their curves
				are not equivalent mathematical entities. This being so, I must
				show how they differ and how the foundations of circle analysis
				must change. Clearly, I cannot do this with raw equations.
				Reworking an entire algorithm takes a good deal of groundwork,

				and others solidified this error by formalizing it with their
				calculi</A>, and Cauchy covered up the error with an even less
				physical formalization. For the past 200 years, this error has
				been unrecognized because it was unrecognizable. As the
				calculus—and thereby the curve—is now taught, no one could
				possibly uncover any of this. Both the calculus and circle
				geometry are taught as a series of increasingly abstract
				equations, not as logical steps, physically grounded. But when
				you return to the diagrams, as I have here, it is shockingly easy
				to see that circular motion is another big mess. </FONT></FONT>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Quantitatively,
				this may be THE biggest error in all of math and physics, since
				every single physical equation with π in it must now be thrown
				out and redone. The transform π must be jettisoned from all of
				kinematics and dynamics.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>You may ask
				how physics has existed with such errors for so long. Shouldn’t
				all engineering be impossible with errors of this magnitude?
				Shouldn’t all of our machines immediately break and crash? Not
				necessarily. Because we make the same mistakes in all our
				equations, the equations are correct relative to each other. Most
				of engineering is concerned with relative numbers, not absolute
				numbers. For example, it is more important in physics—at least
				as a matter of engineering—that we know the how the gravity of
				Venus compares to the gravity of Mars, than that we know the real
				gravity of either one. If we are wrong about all of them in the
				same amount, most of our machines will still work. Only rarely
				will a mistake in absolute numbers affect engineering of any
				kind. I could show this with specific examples, but I believe it
				is clear enough regardless. </FONT></FONT>

				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Now to sum
				up. You should take from this paper several things: 1) There is
				no such thing as an orbital velocity. An orbital “velocity”
				is actually the summation of three separate and separable
				velocities. In the diagram above, the orbital motion is AB - BD +
				DC, which is obviously the same as AD + DC. 2) A curve may not be
				measured by straightening it out like a piece of string. In any
				physical situation, the distance traveled along a curve is found
				by running perpendiculars and in no other way. As I have shown,
				you do not have to go to any limit: all you have to do is draw
				the largest perpendiculars. In the example above, you do not need
				to draw lots of little steps and go to a limit: just draw AD and
				DC. As long as AB equals AO, AB will always equal AC. 3) The
				circumference equation is now C = 8r = 4d. This means that π is
				extinct. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>All the
				thousands of mathematicians who have been chasing more and more
				precise values for π have been chasing a phantom. For, although
				their equations may be correct in most ways, their assumptions
				are wrong. Their first assumption has always been that Newton
				understood circle geometry and that he understood how to do
				calculus. Mathematicians and physicists since Newton have simply
				taken his postulates as true: they have taken his algorithm and
				attempted to fine tune it. But the algorithm is faulty at the
				foundational level, and has been for millennia. Newton's first
				and fundamental lemmae—which are themselves based on the
				assumptions of the Greeks—are all false. At the limit, the
				tangent is not equal to the chord, <A HREF="http://milesmathis.com/lemma.html">as
				I have shown elsewhere</A>. The chord is never approached by
				either the arc or the tangent, or by any other mathematical
				entity in trigonometry or calculus. In creating or measuring the
				circle, we are not exhausting polygons, either inscribed or
				superscribed, so the chord is immaterial. To create or measure
				the circle, we should do it as I have done it here: with
				orthogonal vectors. If we choose the correct vectors, we do not
				have to approach any limit. We can use a sort of exhaustion, but
				we do this only to show that the largest vectors are correct to
				begin with. I &quot;exhausted&quot; a process of measurement
				above (by increasing the steps along the arc), but this
				exhaustion did not take our distance to a limit. It only showed
				that, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>as a
				distance</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>,
				one path was equivalent to another. Since this was what we were
				seeking with the circumference, it gave us a very simple and
				quick method. By choosing precisely the right analysis and
				interval, we were able to solve without calculus, without limits,
				without infinitesimals, without ultimate ratios, and without
				integration or differentiation. In a nutshell, I returned to the
				pre-calculus analysis of the Greeks, which lay under all modern
				analyses. By correcting that analysis in a simple but crucial
				way, I have changed and corrected every piece of circular math
				and analysis since then. This means that π is now a relic
				(except perhaps in scalar equations, like area and so on). Some
				will be distraught that so much earnest work has been wasted,
				both in mathematics and physics; but rather than hone an error to
				the end of time, surely it is better to discover the simple truth
				at last.</FONT></FONT></P>

				August 30, 2016</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>:
				One of my readers suggested an easy proof of π=4 using a
				surveyor's wheel. That is one of those rolling distance
				measurers, with a handle. He said that since it was a rolling
				wheel, exactly like a cycloid, they must use cycloid math to give
				you the number you read on the meter. Since I have never used
				one, I checked, and they don't use cycloid math, they use pi.
				That's very curious, wouldn't you say? It looks like a cover up
				to me. You will say that in measuring a distance—as a surveyor
				would need—there is no reason to use cycloid math and every
				reason to use pi. In that case, you aren't interested in the
				length of the cycloid, you are interested in the length of the
				straight line on the ground. True, as far as it goes. But see if
				you can follow me on this. What if you are measuring the length
				of </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><B>a curve</B></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>on the ground, using a
				surveyor's wheel? By using π, you assume the curve is just like
				the straight line, and indeed that is what the surveyor's wheel
				tells you. But if instead of measuring the length of the curve on
				the ground, what if you wished to measure the new curved cycloid
				you have drawn in the air with your wheel? In other words, you
				have taken a cycloid and wrapped it around a curve. Will the
				length stay the same? I suppose the mainstream would say yes, but
				the obvious answer is NO. You have just integrated an external
				motion into the math, so there is no logical way the length could
				stay the same. In other words, you have just imported another
				variable of the x, y, z sort, and that variable cannot be zero.
				Consult the integral above, which requires a variable for each
				constituent motion. The length of the curved cycloid cannot
				logically be the same as the original cycloid. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Maybe some of
				my readers can grasp that, given that the cycloid is planar
				rather than linear. It may help them visualize this. Take the red
				cycloid curve in the diagram above and imagine curving the entire
				diagram. If you don't see what I mean, think of cutting the whole
				curve out with scissors and pasting it onto a curved surface,
				like a soup can. After you do that, answer me this question: is
				that new curved curve you have created the same as the flat curve
				above? No, of course not. If you were writing an equation for it,
				you couldn't use the same equation. You would have to write a new
				more complex equation, with an extra variable in it to express
				the new curvature. Since that new variable could not be zero, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>it
				would necessarily change the length of the curve. </I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Well,
				if that is true, then the same logic must apply to </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>any</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>curve, whether is it wrapped
				by a cycloid or wrapped by a simple line. The length of the curve
				cannot be measured in the same way you measure a straight line,
				since the curve will always have an additional non-zero variable
				to integrate into the math. </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>The
				length of the curve will always be greater than the length of the
				“equivalent” straight line. </I></FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>Some will
				say, “That may be true, but using cycloid math in a surveyor's
				wheel won't solve it.” True enough. I didn't mean to imply that
				using cycloid math would give you more useful numbers for the
				wheel. I meant that using pi and the naive math they do use was a
				cover up, since it hid the problem I have just shown you. And I
				meant that by using cycloid math, I could show why the surveyor's
				wheel must fail to correctly measure any curve. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>No doubt many
				will answer me, “The surveyor's wheel </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>doesn't</I></FONT></FONT>
				<FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>fail, since what a surveyor is
				interested in is a simple length, not some mystical kinematic
				distance like you are inventing here.” But that is false as
				well. Let us say a surveyor is measuring a running track for the
				Olympics. Well, he has to measure both the straight legs of the
				track and the curves. And what he wants to know is how far the
				runners have run, right? Well, running is kinematic. It is like a
				little orbit. It requires real bodies to move through the curves.
				It is not just curves sitting on the ground, it is curves being
				run in real time. Therefore, to calculate the correct distances
				through the curves, the surveyor must integrate all the motions
				involved. Treating the curves as equivalent to the straights will
				fail to do that. And yes, I am telling you the inside lane of the
				standard track is longer than 400 meters. Or, the runners are
				running considerably farther than 400 meters. This should be easy
				to prove by timing groups of top athletes through straights and
				curves. I predict it will be found that the athletes </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5><I>appear
				</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>to move
				through the curves much slower than can be accounted for by
				stress on the inside leg, etc. But if you use pi=4 to measure the
				length of the curve, this discrepancy will vanish. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="garamond"><FONT SIZE=5>In fact, I
				find that some tests have been run, confirming this. At <A HREF="http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3347&amp;context=etd">this
				link to Brigham Young University</A> [p. 25], we find that
				“Depending upon the track, athletes may spend up to 60% of the
				race on the turn (P. R. Greene &amp; Monheit, 1990).” Holy Cow!
				60%? And no one ever thought that was strange? Using π=4, we
				would predict 56% of the time to be spent in the curves [4/7.14].
				The other 4% would then be given to tighter curves requiring more
				leg adjustments. Using running dynamics, you would never predict
				a slowdown that great [60/40] in the turns. That's a slowdown of
				33%. But if we give most of that slowdown to a mismeasurement of
				the curve using pi [a “slowdown” of 21%], it makes more
				sense.] </FONT></FONT>
