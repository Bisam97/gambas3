<h3>Welcome to you, curious ! You're going to know almost everything about 
me...</h3>

<p><img src="whoami.png" align=left hspace=16>My name is Benoît Minisini. 
I am a thirty years old french man living in the suburbs of Paris. Programming
is one my passion since I was twelve, and is now my job for six years. 
This passion started with the <i>Basic</i> language on a <i>CPC Amstrad 
464</i>, and later on an <i>Atari 520 STE</i>. Of course, now, I am using 
many other languages, but I never forgot that I have learned and done a 
lot with <i>Basic</i>.</p>

<p>I was always fond of writing languages, compilers, assemblers, and
interpreters. I wrote a Z80 assembler on <i>Amstrad</i> and an interpreted 
language that consumed all its memory.</p>

<p>Later, during my studies at the E.P.I.T.A., I wrote a Lisp interpreter under
Windows 3.1. During six months, I discovered <i>Windows</i>, its stupid memory
model, the <i>Microsoft</i> C compiler, and its numerous bugs.</p>

<p>Today, I keep on raging with the <b><i>Gambas</i></b> language, contributing
with my own experience to the free software world.</p>

<p>Thanks to my boss, I have a half-time job, so I have worked actively on
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> for three years.</p>

<p>But I have other passions too, that burn a lot of time. There is music - I'm
playing flute for a long time - and theatre now... I started to study
acting at the "Cours Simon" in Paris since September 2002, and it takes me more
than 16 hours a week.</p>
 
<p>So, the development of <b><i>Gambas</i></b> is much slower :-( But don't be 
afraid, I will not abandon <b><i>Gambas</i></b>, whatever happens in the next 
months.</p>

<p>I hope your curiousity was satisfied... :-)</p>
