<h3>I have...</h3>

<p>Have you carefully read all <i>tips of the day</i> ?

<p>I suggest you read the 
<a href="http://gambasdoc.org/help/doc/diffvb">
Differences From VB</a> page in the Wiki encyclopaedia.

<h3>I want to open a file with the <i>OPEN</i> instruction, and I get
this error message : "Type mismatch. Wanted File, got Integer instead"</h3>

<p>The <i>OPEN</i> instruction of <i><b>Gambas</b></i> does not work like
the <i>Visual Basic</i> one. It does not return the file as an integer, but
as a <i>File</i> object.</p>

<p>Instead of typing :</p>

<pre>  DIM handle AS Integer
  ...
  OPEN "myfile" FOR READ AS #handle</pre>

<p>you must type :</p>

<pre>  DIM handle AS File
  ...
  OPEN "myfile" FOR READ AS #handle</pre>

<h3>I have defined a public variable in a module, but when I want to use it
from another module, I get an "undefined identifier" error.</h3>

<p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> works more like <i>Java</i> than like <i>Visual
Basic</i>.</p>

<p>I mean that a module is exactly like a class, except that all its members
are static.</p>

<p>So, if you declare a variable in a module named <i>MyModule</i> this
way&nbsp;:</p>

<pre>  PUBLIC MyVariable AS String</pre>

<p>then to access it, you must use the following syntax&nbsp;:</p>

<pre>  PRINT MyModule.MyVariable</pre>

<p>There are no global public variables like in Visual Basic, because
I think it is a completely stupid and useless feature. Trust me&nbsp;! ;-)</p>
