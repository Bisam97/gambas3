<h3>I will try to depict the main features of <b><i>Gambas</i></b>
and what sets it from the other languages.</h3>

<p><img src="gambas-2.png" align=right hspace=16 border=0>
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> is, before all, a <i>Basic</i> language with
object extensions. A program written with <b><i>Gambas</i></b> is a
set of files. Each file describes a class, in terms of object
programming. The class files are compiled, then executed by an
interpreter. From this point of view, it is very inspired by
<i>Java</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> is made up of the following programs&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>A compiler.</p>
  <li><p>An interpreter.</p>
  <li><p>An archiver.</p>
  <li><p>A graphical user interface component.</p>
  <li><p>A development environment.</p>
</ul>

<p>The development environment is written with <b><i>Gambas
</i></b> itself, so that I can show the abilities of the language.
And it is very useful for debugging&nbsp;!</p>

<h3>What are the features that set <i><b>Gambas</b></i> from the
other languages&nbsp;?</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>A <b><i>Gambas</i></b> project is stored under one
directory. The archiver transforms the project directory
structure in one sole executable file.</p>

<li><p>Compiling a project only requires the compilation of the
modified classes. Every external reference of a class is solved
dynamically at the execution time.</p>

<li><p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> has a component architecture that allows
to extend the language. Anyone can write components as shared libraries 
that dynamically add new native classes to the interpreter. The 
component architecture will be freely documented as soon as possible.</p>

<li><p>By default, the <b><i>Gambas</i></b> interpreter is a
text-only program. The component architecture is used for writing
the graphical user interface part of the language.</p>

<li><p>As the graphical user interface is implemented as a
component, <b><i>Gambas</i></b> will be able to be independent of
any toolkit&nbsp;! You will be able to write a program, and choose
the toolkit later : <i>GTK+</i>, <i>Qt</i>, etc.</p>

<li><p>I have decided to start implementing the graphical user
interface with the <i>Qt</i> toolkit, as it is easier for me. Later,
I will write a <i>GTK+</i> component that will have almost the same
interface as the <i>Qt</i> component. I think <i>GTK+ 2.0 </i>will
have enough features to be as powerful as <i>Qt 3.0</i></p>

<li><p>Any window or dialog box can be used like a control. You 
cannot do such a thing with <i>Visual Basic</i> without
using <i>ActiveX</i> (bless you&nbsp;! I know, I'm a bit allergic
too ;-) ).</p>
