<div class="title">Introduction</div>

<h3>This project aims at making a graphical development environment based on
a <i>Basic</i> interpreter, so that we have a language like <i>Visual
Basic&trade;</i> under <i>Linux&trade;</i>.</h3>

<p>
The phenomenal quantity of bugs and inconsistencies that makes <i>Visual
Basic</i> so delightful persuaded me to start this project ;-)</p>

<p><font>
It seems that <i>Microsoft</i> was aware of the poor quality of its
language, as <i>VB .Net</i> is not backward compatible with older versions
of <i>Visual Basic</i>. I think they have thrown away the <i>Visual Basic</i>
interpreter source code, and <i>VB .Net</i> is just a <i>.Net</i> runtime
compiler whose syntax <i>looks like</i> the old <i>Visual Basic</i> one.
</font></p>

<p>I want to clear up any misunderstanding immediately. <b><i>Gambas</i></b>
does <i>not</i> try to be compatible with <i>Visual Basic</i>, and will
<i>never</i> be. I'm convinced that its syntax and internals are far better
than the one's of its proprietary cousin ;-)</p>

<p>I took from <i>Visual Basic</i> what I found useful : the <i>Basic</i>
language, the development environment, and the easiness to quickly make
programs with user interfaces. That's all. I could have chosen the syntax
of almost any other language, but I was fed with Basic from
childhood, so...</p>

<p>I dislike the bad level of common <i>Visual Basic</i>
programmers, often due to bad pratices imposed by the bugs and strangeness
of this language. So I will try to make <b><i>Gambas</i></b> as coherent,
logical and reliable as possible, and I hope that <b><i>Gambas</i></b>
programmers will make effort in return! :-)</p>

<p>The kernel of <b><i>Gambas</i></b> is now stabilized, if not completely well 
documented. There is a component example to help people learning how to write 
components.</p>

<p>I hope other people will join me to help to increase the possibilities of
the language. There is so much to do!</p>

<div class="title">Features</div>

<h3>I will try to depict the main features of <b><i>Gambas</i></b>
and what sets it from the other languages.</h3>

<p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> is, before all, a <i>Basic</i> language with
object extensions. A program written with <b><i>Gambas</i></b> is a
set of files. Each file describes a class, in terms of object
programming. The class files are compiled, then executed by an
interpreter. From this point of view, it is very inspired by
<i>Java</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> is made up of the following programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A compiler.</li>
  <li>An interpreter.</li>
  <li>An archiver.</li>
  <li>A graphical user interface component.</li>
  <li>A development environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The development environment is written with <b><i>Gambas
</i></b> itself, so that I can show the abilities of the language.
And it is very useful for debugging!</p>

<h3>What are the features that set <i><b>Gambas</b></i> from the
other languages?</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>A <b><i>Gambas</i></b> project is stored under one
directory. The archiver transforms the project directory
structure in one sole executable file.</p>

<li><p>Compiling a project only requires the compilation of the
modified classes. Every external reference of a class is solved
dynamically at the execution time.</p>

<li><p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> has a component architecture that allows
to extend the language. Anyone can write components as shared libraries
that dynamically add new native classes to the interpreter. Component can 
be written in <b><i>Gambas</i></b> too. The component architecture is 
documented in the Wiki encyclopaedia.</p>

<li><p>By default, the <b><i>Gambas</i></b> interpreter is a
text-only program. The component architecture is used for writing
the graphical user interface part of the language.</p>

<li><p>As the graphical user interface is implemented as a
component, <b><i>Gambas</i></b> will be able to be independent of
any toolkit! You will be able to write a program, and choose
the toolkit later : <i>GTK+</i>, <i>Qt</i>, etc.</p>

<li><p>I have decided to start implementing the graphical user
interface with the <i>Qt</i> toolkit, as it is easier for me. The
<i>GTK+</i> component is not finished yet, but it will have almost 
the same interface as the <i>Qt</i> component.</p>

<li><p>Any window or dialog box can be used like a control. You
cannot do such a thing with <i>Visual Basic</i> without
using <i>ActiveX</i> (bless you! I know, I'm a bit allergic
too ;-) ).</p>

<li><p><b><i>Gambas</i></b> projects are easily translatable, in any
language.</p>

</ol>

<p>In the very far future (do you hear the <i>Star Trek</i> theme?),
many improvements are planned. Some are needed, the others depends
on my time and my many occupations!</p>

<div class="title">About me</div>

<h3>Welcome to you, curious! You're going to know almost everything about
me...</h3>

<p><img src="whoami.png" align=left hspace=16>My name is Beno&icirc;t Minisini.
I am a thirty-five years old french man living in Paris. Programming
is one my passion since I was twelve, and is now my job for six years.
This passion started with the <i>Basic</i> language on a <i>CPC Amstrad
464</i>, and later on an <i>Atari 520 STE</i>. Of course, now, I am using
many other languages, but I never forgot that I have learned and done a
lot with <i>Basic</i>.</p>

<p>I was always fond of writing languages, compilers, assemblers, and
interpreters. I wrote a Z80 assembler on <i>Amstrad</i> and an interpreted
language that consumed all its memory.</p>

<p>Later, during my studies at the E.P.I.T.A., I wrote a Lisp interpreter under
Windows 3.1. During six months, I discovered <i>Windows</i>, its stupid memory
model, the <i>Microsoft</i> C compiler, and its numerous bugs.</p>

<p>Today, I keep on raging with the <b><i>Gambas</i></b> language, contributing
with my own experience to the free software world.</p>

<p>Thanks to my boss, I have a half-time job, so I have worked actively on
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> for three years.</p>

<p>But I have other passions too, that burn a lot of time. There is music - I'm
playing flute for a long time - and theatre now...</p>

<p>So, the development of <b><i>Gambas</i></b> is not as fast as it could be.</p>

<p>I hope your curiousity was satisfied... :-)</p>

<div class="title">Acknowledgements</div>

<p>
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> is build on top of many free softwares, and
could not exist without them.</p>

<p>So I would like to thank every people involved in the following
projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.mslinux.org"><i>Linux</i></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kde.org/"><i>KDE</i></a></li>
  <li><i>GCC</i> and all of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/"><i>GNU</i></a> tools,
  of course.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/"><i>Qt</i></a> toolkit.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.gimp.org/"><i>GNU Image Manipulation Program</i></a>
  and its toolkit <a href="http://www.gtk.org"><i>GTK+</i></a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"><i>Open Office</i></a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mysql.com"><i>MySQL</i></a> and
  <a href="http://www.postgresql.org"><i>PostgreSQL</i></a> database management
  systems.</li>
  <li>And any other libraries used by <i><b>Gambas</i></b>.
</ul>

<p>Some pieces of code of <i><b>Gambas</i></b> are based on third party
software:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The hash tables management routines are heavily based on the
  <i>Glib</i> ones.</li>
  <li>The date management routines are heavily based on the <i>Glib</i>
  ones as well.</li>
  <li>The <b><i>Gambas</i></b> syntax highlighting editor is based on
  the <i>QMultiLineEdit</i> code of <a href="http://www.trolltech.com" target="_blank">
  <i>Qt</i></a>.</li>
  <li>The image information component is based on source code from 
  <a href="http://php.net" target="_blank"><i>PHP</i></a>.

</ul>

<p>And last but not least, I would like to thank every people who help me
out with programs, patches, program examples, bug tracking, help writing,
financial support, judicious remarks, and so on...</p>
