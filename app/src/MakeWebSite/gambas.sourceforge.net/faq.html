Why did you name this project "<i><b>Gambas</b></i>" ?</h3>

<p>It seems that free projects name are often animals, especially
the programming language ones&nbsp;: <i>Python</i>, <i>Camel</i>,
<i>Bonobo</i>, etc.</p>

<p>And I wanted to have a recursive acronym with the word "Basic" in it.
So, <i><b>Gambas</b></i> <b>A</b>lmost <b>M</b>eans <b>BAS</b>ic !</p>

<h3>Is <i><b>Gambas</b></i> compatible with <i>Visual Basic</i> ?</h3>

<p>No, and it will never be !</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many similarities, but do not expect to take
your old <i>Visual Basic</i> code and run it on <b><i>Gambas</i></b>
without any change.</p>

<p>You can go the <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> page
to find some examples of the differences between the two languages.</p>

<h3>Will <i><b>Gambas</b></i> be compatible with <i>Java</i> or
<i>.Net</i> ?</h3>

<p>Never, I'm afraid. There are many reasons, good and bad :</p>

<ul>

  <li>I'm not Sun nor Microsoft, I do not want to impose one sole language
  for everything everywhere. A stupid thing, isn't it ? :-)</li>

  <li>I want a simple but powerful language, not necesseraly intended 
  for professionals or nerds.
  </li>

  <li>I did it for fun too ! I do like writing compilers, interpreters,
  virtual machines... So I did not use the spec of <i>Java</i> nor
  <i>.Net</i> to write Gambas.</li>

  <li><i><b>Gambas</b></i> IDE is written in Gambas.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Why don't you merge your project with
<i><a href="http://www.kbasic.org" target="_blank">KBasic</a></i> ?</h3>

<p>I think there are too many technical differences between the <i>KBasic</i>
project and mine to merge the two projects.</p>

<p><i>KBasic</i> seems to be based on <i>KDE</i>, and <i>KDE</i> only.
My own interpreter does not depend on any toolkit or graphical environment.
The <b><i>Gambas</i></b> interpreter is a text only program. The graphical
part comes with <i>components</i>.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is only one graphical component, the <i>Qt</i> one.
But, in the future, I plan to write a <i>Gtk+</i> component, so that programs
will be able to equally use <i>Qt</i> or <i>Gtk+</i>, or any other toolkit
that has its own component.</p>

<p>Moreover, the development environment (the tool you use to write
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> programs) is written in <i><b>Gambas</b></i>. The <i>KBasic</i>
development environment seems to be written in <i>C++</i>, not in <i>KBasic</i>.
It is a huge design difference.</p>

<p>So, that was the reasons why I think we could not easily merge...
It is life !</p>

<h3>Can I access my <i>PostgreSQL</i>, <i>MySQL</i>, etc. database with
<b><i>Gambas</i></b> ?</h3>

<p>YES&nbsp;! The database component is not completely terminated yet.
The <i>PostgreSQL</i> database driver is almost terminated, and
the <i>MySQL</i> driver is in progress. If you want to develop a driver for
another database system, tell me. You are welcome&nbsp;!</p>

<hr color=#43C7FF size=4>

<h3>I'm a <i>C</i>/<i>C++</i> programmer. How can I help you ?</h3>

<p>You are welcome !</p>

<p>First you can subscribe to the developer mailing-list and introduce
yourself.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is not a real developer documentation. But you have
a component example named <i>gb.example</i> that is full of comments. By reading
the source of this example, you will understand how to write a component.</p>

<p>If you want to write a database driver for the database component, the
<i>PostgreSQL</i> driver is commented, so that you can more easily know how to do
that.</p>

<p>Of course, I will answer any question and help you as much as I can, provided
that you have spent more than a school year to learn C/C++ :-)</p>

<hr color=#43C7FF size=4>

<h3>I'm not a <i>C</i>/<i>C++</i> programmer. How can I help you ?</h3>

<p>Any help on the following tasks is welcome. No <i>C</i>/<i>C++</i>
programming skill is required !</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Playing with <i><b>Gambas</b></i> and reporting bugs.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Making example programs for beginners, and send them to me so that I
  put them in the source package.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Making a tutorial to show beginners how to write their first
  <i><b>Gambas</b></i> program. It would be a great idea ! :-)</p>
  
  <li>Translate <i><b>Gambas</b></i> into your own language, if it has not
  been done yet. See <a href="translate.html">there</a> for more informaion.</li>

</ul>

<h3>What dawn is this <i>strange</i> formula on the home page&nbsp;?
It is false&nbsp;!</h3>

<p> A bit offending, isn't it ? :-) I saw this formula on a TV show.
A mathematician gave this formula as its favourite one. And I agree...</p>

<p>Well, why is this formula right ?</p>

<p>The reason is that you cannot find any logical contradiction by deciding
that this sum does not diverge. But if you decide that, you must
choose that it equals -1. See that as the limit of geometric series.</p>

<p>A real mathematician would be more explicit :-) I think it is just a
matter of finding the good distance function that makes this sum
converging.</p>

<p>In other words, this sum diverges because you have made logical
hypothetis in the mathemathical set where you calculate numbers. If you
choose other hypothesis, then the sum can converge&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Wow ! They didn't tell you at school ?</p>
