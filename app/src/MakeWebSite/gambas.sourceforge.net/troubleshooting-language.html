<h3>I built a simple <i><b>Gambas</b></i> application by scrupulously
following one of the examples. The application compiles, but don't run.
What's wrong ?</h3>

<p>You must define a startup class in the <i>project properties</i>
dialog, and this startup class must have a static public method
named <i>Main</i> without any argument to act as a startup method.</p>

<p>A bug in the development environment prevents it from displaying a
warning message to the user. It is the reason why nothing happens
when you run the project.</p>

<h3>I created a small project with only one form, and I define this form as
the startup class. When I run the project, nothing happens ! Why ?</h3>

<p>Contrary to <i>Visual Basic</i>, <b><i>Gambas</i></b> form are not
self-executable. As for any other classes, you must define a static
public method named <i>Main</i> so that it works. See above for more
details.</p>

<h3>I want to open a file with the <i>OPEN</i> instruction, and I get
this error message : "Type mismatch. Wanted File, got Integer instead"</h3>

<p>The <i>OPEN</i> instruction of <i><b>Gambas</b></i> does not work like
the <i>Visual Basic</i> one. It does not return the file as an integer, but
as a <i>File</i> object.</p>

<p>Instead of typing :</p>

<pre>  DIM handle AS Integer
  ...
  OPEN "myfile" FOR READ AS #handle</pre>

<p>you must type :</p>

<pre>  DIM handle AS File
  ...
  OPEN "myfile" FOR READ AS #handle</pre>

<h3>When I compile my project, I got an "undefined identifier" error on
a well known class name that seems absolutely correct.</h3>

<p>For example, with the following code :</p>

<pre>  MyControl.Font = font["Luxi Sans 16"]</pre>

<p>When the compiler encounters an identifier, it assumes reading a class name
if the identifier begins with a capital letter.</p>

<p>You have two solutions to solve this problem.</p>

<p>First you can change the identifier first letter, like that :</p>

<pre>  MyControl.Font = Font["Luxi Sans 16"]</pre>

<p>Secondly, you can predeclare the identifier as a class, with the <i>CLASS</i>
keyword. This declaration must be placed at the beginning of the class.</p>

<pre>  CLASS font
  ...
  MyControl.Font = font["Luxi Sans 16"]</pre>
