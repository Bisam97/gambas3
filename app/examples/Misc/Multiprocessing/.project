Description="Learn to use a Task to do some background calculations. \n\nThe Task class allows long running calculations to be executed in spawned\nprocess(es) to prevent UI from blocking during long running calculations.\nIn this example prime numbers up to a max number are calculated which \ntakes some time for big numbes. \n\nTherefore a single Task instance takes care of this calculation in \nthe background."
