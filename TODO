TODO list: always incomplete :-)
--------------------------------

CONFIGURATION

- Raise an error when libffi is not found.

COMPILER

- Compilation error must indicate the column, not only the line.
- Better error message if a class form structure is incorrect. Otherwise the error
  talks about the form generated code.

INTERPRETER

- A stack that can grow dynamically.
- A special syntax to make variable writable once only (for controls variables).
- Add global parameters for each component.
- Make objects printable, with a "_print" hidden method or something else.
- Make objects writable and readable to streams.
- Perl regexp with the MATCH operator.
- An expression can begin with NEW.
- Type mismatch error: print the mismatched values.
- Special runtime debugging commands for dumping all the variables for example.
- A new debugging compilation option to only put line number information in the output files.
- NInstr() -> Count the number of patterns.
/*
- OPTIONAL arguments should takes any expression.
- Class synonymous.
- Array[x] when x < 0 should return Array[Array.Count - x]
- NEW Collection OF String
*/
- If project compilation version < compiler version then => compile all
- Intercept all signals in Application_Signal.
- Structure support
- Callback support
- Sorting two or more arrays at the same time.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

- .startup file, a copy of .project with only startup info inside.
- .project files should be marked as 2.0.
- Renaming controls in the IDE renames the source code too.
- Loading a "form" component needs calling InitControl on classes that are not
  member of the list of controls.
- Bookmarks in editor.
- Manage Object properties in IDE.
- Put a language code in comments, and hide them as needed by the user.
- Make a visual control clipboard.
- Packager should manage component projects.
- A new folder for non-packaged data files ('Notes' ?).

- Fix the GameOfLife example, remove the 'public control' option.
- Fix the Gravity example either.

- Adds automatically the extension to the file in the save file dialog.
- Deleting a currently expanding item in TreeView crashes.
